## Notebooks
In this section you will find the code for the notebook that was used to create this exmaple. Please keep in mind that you will need to provision first an Azure AI Foundry service in Microsoft Azure. I used a text-embedding-3-large model based on Azure OpenAI.
More information about the model that was used to retrieve embeddings can be found here:

Please pay attention to the region because the service is not available in all regions.
