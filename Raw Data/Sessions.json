        "abstract": "In this session, we will delve into two complementary approaches to adopting Microsoft Fabric: the horizontal approach through medallion architecture and the vertical approach through data mesh.\n\nThe horizontal approach will elaborate on how a medallion architecture can be implemented by leveraging Microsoft lakehouse and warehouse, using the data engineering tools. This architecture simplifies data management by organizing data into bronze, silver, and gold layers, ensuring data quality and accessibility at each stage. The bronze layer consists of raw data, the silver layer contains cleaned and enriched data, and the gold layer holds business-ready data. By structuring data in this way, organizations can streamline data processing, improve data governance, and enhance data analytics capabilities.\n\nThe vertical approach will focus on how data mesh allows organizations to better democratize and delegate access to a data platform like Microsoft Fabric. Data mesh decentralizes data ownership by promoting domain-oriented data management, where each domain is responsible for its own data products. This approach empowers teams to manage their own data, fostering innovation and agility. By implementing data mesh, organizations can break down data silos, improve data accessibility, and enable cross-functional collaboration, ultimately leading to more informed decision-making and faster time-to-insight.\n\nThis session will provide a well-detailed explanation of how leveraging these two approaches increases the likelihood of success when adopting and designing a data architecture in Microsoft Fabric. Attendees will gain invaluable insights and practical strategies to enhance their data initiatives and drive organizational growth.",

        "abstract": "The role of BI teams is rapidly evolving. As organizations embrace self-service analytics, traditional BI teams are shrinking, shifting their focus from visualization creation to managing data products and corporate reports. Meanwhile, self-service report development surges—especially with the rise of Copilot and AI—leading to an explosion of analytics assets without meaningful governance.\n<br/><br/>\n\nThis creates an Analytic Danger Zone: a self-service landscape where reports, dashboards, and datasets proliferate without oversight, leading to redundancy, inconsistency, and compliance risks. Many Data & Analytics managers take proactive steps to bring order by implementing DevOps practices like GIT and Azure DevOps. While these tools excel for technical analysts, complementing them with strategies tailored for self-service analytics ensures a more comprehensive governance approach.\n<br/><br/>\nSo, how can organizations govern Power BI effectively without stifling self-service innovation? \n<br/><br/>\nJoin this session to explore:\n<br/><br/>\n✅ The shift from traditional BI to self-service and AI-driven analytics <br/>\n✅ Enhancing Azure DevOps and GIT for zero-effort governance in self-service BI <br/>\n✅ Practical strategies to gain control over the Power BI ecosystem without slowing down business users <br/>\n✅ Moving from managing the process to managing the results\n<br/><br/>\nIf you're a BI leader, data professional, or Power BI administrator navigating the chaos of self-service analytics, this session will equip you with actionable insights to bring governance to the ungoverned.",

        "abstract": "Businesses today want well designed databases which can be used not only by applications but are part of an analytical solution which allows people to interact visually with the data in reports. Are you interested in decreasing and centralizing your Azure costs while continuing to support applications which need a SQL database? Are you interested in migrating an on-premises SQL Server database to the cloud or move away from decentralized manage instance databases? Fabric SQL DB can be the solution as it provides the ability to combine SQL Server functionality with Business Intelligence Analysis.\n<br/><br/>\nFor many existing applications, having a SQL Database is a requirement. We will review the processes for doing maintenance for SQL DB inside of Microsoft Fabric, focusing on the “knob free” methods to minimize the steps involved and migration from an on prem database. We will examine the different cost models to demonstrate how this solution can be used to minimize costs and decrease management effort through automated maintenance and centralized resource monitoring.\n<br/><br/>\nThis session will provide you with the use cases to determine when and why an SQL DB inside of Fabric can benefit your data environment.",

We’ll review the existing object level security features and highlight key updates and changes from the new release. Next, learn all about the new features of row and column level security. We will give practical examples showing how these features work and where to leverage them in your organization.<br/>\nWe’ll explore the two main integration patterns for Fabric engines: delegated and passthrough. We’ll discuss the tradeoffs of each pattern, and situations for using one over the other. For SQL Endpoint and Semantic models we will explore their existing permissions and how that layers over OneLake security.<br/>\nFurthermore, we will examine the use of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric to simplify data management and discuss the special security considerations required for different types of shortcuts.<br/>\nThis session is a must-attend for data professionals seeking to enhance their understanding and implementation of OneLake's comprehensive security model. Equip yourself with the knowledge to safeguard your data and ensure compliance with organizational security policies.",

With the introduction of Microsoft Fabric, self-service users now have access to advanced tools like Dataflow Gen2 for appending data and Notebooks for powerful updates like upserts (merge into) and Change Data Feed (CDF) for tracking changes.\n<br/><br/>\nThis session highlights the evolution from traditional analytic tools, starting with Excel, moving through Power BI, and culminating in Fabric's expanded ecosystem, to empower business users to build more robust data ingestion patterns. We’ll explore how these new tools support scenarios where data sources are primarily self-service processes from other business areas rather than governed data warehouses.\n<br/><br/>\nLearn how to evaluate source reliability and design solutions accordingly, starting with landing zones and extending through transformation layers.\n<br/><br/>\nEspecially if you're working with inconsistent data sources, this session provides practical guidance for creating future-proof architectures for data ingestion that bridge the gap between self-service flexibility and enterprise-grade reliability.",

It’s about designing something that connects, engages, and makes people say \"Whoa, that’s cool—and I actually understand it!\" And that’s where this session comes in.\n<br/><br/>\nWe’ll talk about the magic of UX Design for Power BI and how simple design choices can completely change the way people interact with your data. No jargon, no fluff—just practical tips you can actually use. Together, we’ll cover: <br/>\n- How humans really process visual information <br/>\n- Easy design hacks like alignment, color, and simplifying the chaos <br/>\n- Accessibility tips to make sure everyone can engage with your reports.\n<br/><br/> \nThis isn’t about turning you into a designer overnight—it’s about giving you the tools to make your data shine. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, this is your chance to level up!\n<br/><br/>\nSo, let’s roll up our sleeves and bring your reports to life.

When capacities start to reach their limits we are left with 3 options: Scale up (costs money), scale out (costs money), or optimize! Since optimization is free other than the value of our time, why not start optimization with our favorite artifact already on our capacities: The semantic model?\n<br/> <br/>\n\nIn this session, we will skip past the basics of star schema and dive into why optimization is for everybody, not just the large-format models out there, as well as a practical application of how to leverage a combination of Microsoft-official and free third-party tools to ensure your semantic layer is lean and performant, leaving more capacity units for the other Fabric workloads. Expect to hear about creative approaches to star schema modeling, automated analysis of the model, and how to pick up where the automated tools leave off for further optimization.",

Are you reluctant to change the name of a table or column because you don't know all the places it could be referenced?\n<br/><br/>\nTracking the design changes of a SQL database over time and across multiple environments (dev, test, and prod) can be difficult. And if you have multiple team members who can make changes, then coordinating those changes is also challenging.\n<br/><br/>\nA database project in SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT, or Visual Studio) defines the schema of a database using the practice of \"Desired State Configuration\". This means that all the scripts in the database project are CREATE statements, and the scripts as a whole define the desired state of the database. Using this project source code, we can deploy to any target database and the deployment process will apply all the schema changes necessary to bring that target to the desired schema.\n<br/><br/>\nIn this session I will show the important features of database projects and the development practices necessary to ensure that your deployments are as fast as possible and retain the existing data that may be present in the target database.\nI'll show the value of the strong schema checking, refactoring support for object renaming, and how to implement default security, automated data patches, and support for referencing external objects, such as cross-database table references.\nFinally I'll show how you can use a git repository in Azure DevOps and have code reviews and project compilation checks as part of a check-in operation.\n<br/><br/>\nIf you use database projects in SSDT, you can be much more confident in the quality of your SQL code and in the reliability of your database deployments.",
