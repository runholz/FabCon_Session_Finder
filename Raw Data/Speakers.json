When he also saw the BI market consolidating with Power BI, he positioned Lumel to become the #1 Microsoft Power BI AppSource Partner. He also predicted the rise of native apps on top of data platforms as organizations look to eliminate data silos as a prerequisite to make their data AI-ready. So, he doubled down on his vision of building an integrated Lumel native app that consolidates planning, master data, reporting and analytics on top of semantic models and envisions Lumel as the new “Face of Data” for everyday application needs.",

He soon landed on Power BI, but also realized quickly that the development and engineering tools and practices were nothing like the ones well established in software development. This is how pbi-tools started as a project, the only complete source control solution for Power BI.\n<br/><br/>\nDuring many years of leading a data management team at YouGov, he experienced the benefits of those efforts every day. Having open sourced the project in fall of 2021, Mathias spent a lot of his free time bringing source control and DevOps practices to the wider Power BI community. Today, as the founder of navidata.io, he focuses on the need for robust DataOps workflows and tooling across the entire Microsoft Fabric ecosystem.\n<br/><br/>\nIn addition to his open source engagements, Mathias cares deeply about his role as an enterprise technology leader. Like many, once having started as a single contributor technologist, he had to pivot significantly when he moved into a manager role, responsible for building, stabilizing and growing a team of data engineers, analysts and architects. Mathias is now passionately sharing the many experiences and learnings that came out of that journey with the community.",
